            <p>In <strong>October 2022</strong>, Buzzy Bee <strong>successfully</strong> organized a groundbreaking two-day event at Funky Farm, Kepayan, with the invaluable support of like-minded individuals. This remarkable occasion united people from diverse backgrounds, providing a platform to discuss the impactful work undertaken to improve the lives of animals and outline future plans.</p>
            <p>Among the notable speakers was Puan Faridah Malai, a compassionate individual who has devoted over a decade to personally feeding stray dogs throughout Kota Kinabalu. Her insightful presentation shed light on the issue of stray overpopulation and emphasized the significance of Trap Neuter Release (TNR) programs. Miracles Mission, an esteemed organization, showcased their resources and shared valuable insights on the implementation of TNR initiatives. The prevalence of TNR as an effective means of reducing the number of stray animals resonated deeply with pet owners in attendance, prompting a reconsideration of their decision not to neuter their pets. </p>
            <p>The event served as a profound learning experience, offering a comprehensive understanding of the commendable efforts undertaken by various organizations to ensure the well-being and safety of animals. Attendees were inspired to explore opportunities for their own involvement and support.</p>
          <p>The two-day event proved to be an enriching experience, not only providing valuable insights on responsible pet ownership and animal care but also yielding significant financial support for the three participating NGOs. Moreover, the event turned out to be a life-changing moment for a fortunate little puppy, as it found its forever home amidst the gathering. Through a combination of education, fundraising, and adoption success, the event showcased the power of community engagement and collective efforts in making a lasting impact on the lives of animals.</p>

By sharing compelling facts and statistics, we emphasize the transformative benefits of adopting animals, including saving lives, reducing pet overpopulation, and providing loving homes to those in need. We are proud to collaborate with reputable animal shelters and rescue organizations in our area, working together to support their adoption efforts. Through heartwarming success stories, we highlight the joy and fulfillment that come from giving animals a second chance at life. We provide clear information on the adoption process, addressing any concerns and misconceptions potential adopters may have. By promoting adoption events, sharing inspiring stories, and offering incentives, we strive to create a community of responsible pet owners who understand the rewards of adoption

                    <span><strong> Why do we do this:</strong><br>“There are more surrendered and abandoned animals than adoptions, causing animal shelters to be overcrowded”- New Strait Times, 2022. During the pandemic, as every social media platforms, newspapers and radio report on the struggles that humans are going through during the pandemic, there was little to no mention of the struggles animals were going through. Many of the animal welfare organizations were struggling with feeding their animals and are becoming overcrowded as many more pet owners decide to abandon their pet because of the fear of contracting covid through their animals (this is impossible by the way!).

                    <span>Buzzy Bee did their research and spoke to NGOs such as Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Borneo Animal Welfare Society Sabah (BAWSS) and much more on how they are coping during the pandemic. Most of them reported having limited food for the animals in their care, not having enough money to buy meds and care for those that are not well and also a lack of help as many go into isolation as the priority becomes their own care. As we understand the fear that the pandemic has caused for many of us, we tend to forget about those who don’t have a voice to speak up and ask for help.
